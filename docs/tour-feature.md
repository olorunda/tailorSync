# TailorFit Gamified Tour Feature

This document explains how the gamified tour feature works in TailorFit and how to maintain it.

## Overview

The gamified tour feature provides an interactive, game-like introduction to TailorFit for first-time users who have completed the onboarding process. The tour is based on the gamified user guide and presents the application's features as quests with rewards.

## Implementation Details

### Database Changes

- Added a `tour_completed` boolean field to the `users` table to track whether a user has completed the tour.

### User Model Changes

- Added `tour_completed` to the `$fillable` array in the `User` model.
- Added a `needsTour()` method to the `User` model that returns `true` if the user has completed onboarding but not the tour.

### Tour Controller

- Created a `TourController` with a `completeTour()` method that marks the tour as completed for the authenticated user.

### Routes

- Added a route for the `completeTour()` method at `/tour/complete`.

### JavaScript and CSS

- Created a `tour.js` file that contains the tour steps and initialization logic.
- Created a `tour.css` file that contains styles for the tour elements.
- Added the Intro.js library for the tour implementation.

### Integration

- Modified the head partial to include the Intro.js library, our custom CSS, and our custom JavaScript.
- Added logic to check if the tour should be shown based on the user's `needsTour()` method.

## Tour Content

The tour is based on the "Beginner's Path" from the gamified user guide and includes the following steps:

1. Introduction to the Workshop Tour quest
2. Dashboard overview
3. Financial summary
4. Revenue vs expenses chart
5. Orders by status chart
6. Time frame selection
7. Preview of the Client Management quest
8. Preview of the Order Management quest
9. Quest completion

Each step includes a title, description, and in some cases, quest-related information like rewards and XP.

## How to Modify the Tour

### Adding or Modifying Tour Steps

To add or modify tour steps, edit the `getTourSteps()` function in the `tour.js` file. Each step is an object with the following properties:

- `title`: The title of the step
- `intro`: The content of the step
- `element` (optional): The CSS selector for the element to highlight

### Styling the Tour

To modify the appearance of the tour, edit the `tour.css` file. This file contains styles for the Intro.js elements and custom styles for our gamified tour elements.

### Changing Tour Behavior

To change the behavior of the tour, edit the `initTour()` function in the `tour.js` file. This function configures the tour options and event listeners.

## Testing

To test the tour feature:

1. Create a new user or reset an existing user's `tour_completed` flag to `false`.
2. Complete the onboarding process.
3. Navigate to the dashboard to see the tour.

## Future Enhancements

Potential future enhancements for the tour feature:

1. Add more quests based on the other paths in the gamified user guide.
2. Implement a progress tracking system that shows the user's progress through the quests.
3. Add rewards and badges that are displayed in the user's profile.
4. Create a tour for each main feature of the application.
5. Allow users to restart the tour from their profile settings.
